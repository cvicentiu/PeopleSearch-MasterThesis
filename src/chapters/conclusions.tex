Clustering named  based entities is a difficult task, as all the WEPS competitions show.
Nonetheless, our approach manages to compare similarly in regards to the recall score.
Precision is better than the best WEPS submission, however it is difficult to quantify
if the result represents a direct improvement as the datasets are different.
Looking at the practical aspect of the classifier, we are able to correctly
identify 60\% of positively matched pairs with close to 90\% accuracy.

Compared to our previous unsupervised approach, the supervised approach performs
better, improves running time and increases test dataset maximum size due to the
linear complexity of the classification step.

For future development, we plan to extend the number of features to not only
text based derivatives. A very difficult to use but potentially very useful feature
is the similarity between pictures available in the documents. This however requires
a completely different approach and probably a dataset that is a lot larger.
