In the age of the Internet, the access to data has become a commodity. However,
each day the internet is filled with more and more information. Finding specific
data within the sea of documents is particularly challenging. Search engines
retrieve a set of documents based on keywords. Sometimes the number of documents
retrieved is in the order of millions. This huge number poses a problem when it
comes to finding information related to specific people. The nature of human 
names causes a lot of confusion during search. There are around 90000 names for 
a number of 100 million individuals. The level of ambiguity is very high and 
there is a big need for machines to be able to gather, classify and return 
correct and meaningful results when a person name is queried. This paper aims to 
provide a method of classifying web pages, more specifically social network
profiles belonging to various individuals. The system proposed solves the problem:
\em{Given a set of social network profiles, which ones belong to the same
same person?}
